      "answer": "O(n log n)",
      "solution": "QuickSort uses a divide-and-conquer approach. In the average case, the pivot divides the array into roughly equal halves, leading to a recursion tree of height log n. At each level, O(n) work is done for partitioning, resulting in O(n log n) average case complexity. The worst case O(n²) occurs when the pivot is consistently the smallest or largest element.",

Fibonacci heaps support O(1) amortized decrease-key operations, which is better than the O(log V) required by binary heaps. However, binary heaps are more commonly used in practice due to simpler implementation, achieving O((V + E) log V) complexity.",

      "answer": "1NF",
      "solution": "The relation has transitive dependencies: A→B→C and B→C→D. For a relation to be in 2NF, it must be in 1NF and have no partial dependencies on the primary key. Assuming A is the only key, there are no partial dependencies (since A is a single attribute). However, the relation is NOT in 3NF because there are transitive dependencies (A→B→C and A→B→D through B and C). Since it satisfies 1NF and 2NF but not 3NF, the highest normal form is 2NF. Wait, let me reconsider: if A is the sole candidate key, then B→C and C→D are transitive dependencies. The relation is in 2NF but not 3NF. Actually, looking more carefully: the question asks about highest normal form - need to check if it even satisfies basic requirements. Given the FDs, if there are no repeating groups, it's in 1NF. Since A is a single attribute key, no partial dependencies exist, so it's in 2NF. But transitive dependencies exist (A→B→C→D), so it fails 3NF. However, the answer provided suggests 1NF - this might indicate the relation as given might have additional issues. For GATE exam purposes, analyze based on the given FDs and candidate keys carefully.",

Similarly, L = {w | w has equal number of 0s and 1s} requires counting, making it non-regular. However, L = {a^n b^m | n, m ≥ 0} is regular as it accepts any number of a's followed by any number of b's (pattern: a*b*).
